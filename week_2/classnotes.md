So long as a compiled language produces a standalone executeable, it can be run on a computer because it is compile into machine code.

There is a performance cost for interpreted language because they need to be interpreted at runtime. Compiled languages are checked at compilation.

**Look into Pure Functions and JIT**

JIT compiler takes code and created a .pyc file, when that code is run again it uses the .pyc file instead of re-interpreting. This is how we squeeze performance out of interpreted languages, this is just an idea. **Must be a PURE function more maximum efficiency.**
